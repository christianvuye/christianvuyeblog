# ADR-001: Database Backup Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context

The Django blog application currently has no data protection mechanism. As we prepare for deployment and begin creating valuable content, we need a reliable backup strategy to protect against:

- Data loss due to hosting platform failures
- Accidental data deletion through admin interface
- Database corruption during migrations
- Need for environment synchronization (dev/staging/prod)

The blog contains critical content including:
- Blog posts with rich text formatting (CKEditor 5 content)
- Categories and post relationships
- Navigation posts (roadmap, projects, about pages)
- User accounts and admin access

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive backup strategy with the following components:

### 1. Django Management Command
- Create `backup_db` management command using Django's built-in `dumpdata`
- Include all models and preserve relationships
- Generate timestamped, compressed backup files
- Provide both full and incremental backup options

### 2. Storage Strategy
- **Local backups**: Store in `backups/` directory (excluded from git)
- **Cloud storage**: AWS S3 for production reliability and scalability
- **Retention policy**: Keep daily backups for 30 days, weekly for 12 weeks, monthly for 12 months

### 3. Backup Automation
- **Development**: Manual execution via management command
- **Production**: Scheduled via hosting platform (Heroku Scheduler, cron jobs, GitHub Actions)
- **Pre-migration**: Automatic backup before each migration

### 4. Restoration Process
- Create `restore_db` management command for easy restoration
- Support restoration from specific backup files
- Include data validation after restoration

### 5. Cloud Provider Choice: AWS S3
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard with 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability
- Integrates well with most hosting platforms
- Cost-effective for small data volumes
- Mature Python SDK (boto3)
- Versioning and lifecycle management built-in

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Data safety**: Protection against all common data loss scenarios
- **Deployment confidence**: Safe to deploy knowing rollback is possible
- **Development workflow**: Easy to sync data between environments
- **Compliance ready**: Foundation for GDPR, backup requirements
- **Scalability**: S3 scales with application growth

### Negative
- **Additional complexity**: New dependencies and configuration
- **Cost**: Small ongoing S3 storage costs (~$1-5/month initially)
- **Setup overhead**: Initial AWS account and IAM configuration required
- **Monitoring needed**: Backup failures need alerting

### Neutral
- **Recovery time**: Restoration process will take 1-5 minutes depending on data size
- **Storage growth**: Backup storage will grow with content, manageable with retention policy

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Local Backups
1. Create Django management command
2. Implement local file storage
3. Add basic scheduling capability

### Phase 2: Cloud Integration
1. Add AWS S3 configuration
2. Implement cloud upload functionality
3. Add retention policy management

### Phase 3: Automation
1. Set up production scheduling
2. Add pre-migration hooks
3. Implement monitoring and alerting

### Dependencies
- `boto3` for AWS S3 integration
- Environment variables for AWS credentials
- Production scheduling platform capability

## Alternatives Considered

### Google Drive API
- **Pros**: Simpler setup, familiar interface
- **Cons**: Less reliable, rate limiting, not designed for automated backups

### Dropbox API
- **Pros**: Easiest setup
- **Cons**: Storage limitations, not enterprise-grade

### Database-specific tools (pg_dump, mysqldump)
- **Pros**: More efficient for large databases
- **Cons**: Database-specific, doesn't preserve Django relationships as cleanly

### File-based backups only
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation
- **Cons**: Doesn't handle media files, less portable across environments
