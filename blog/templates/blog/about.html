    <h2>üëã About me</h2>
        
        <p>Hey ‚Äî I'm Christian Vuye.</p>
        
        <p>I'm a builder, software developer, entrepreneur, fitness enthousiast, and eternal learner. But most importantly: I am curious and constantly looking to update my understanding of how the world I works. 
            I build things with Python and Django, tinker with AI and data, and other times dive deep into the rabit hole on some esoteric topic. 
            I've worked in games, freelanced for big names like Honda, co-founded multiple startups, and broken a sweat trying to outpace both burnout and automation.</p>
        
        <p>This blog, Stay Foolish, is where I write as a fool at everything and an expert at nothing. 
            I don't claim authority ‚Äî just curiosity.</p>
        
        <h2>üéØ Why "Stay Foolish"?</h2>
        
        <p>Because most of the things I've learned started with being wrong.</p>
        
        <p>This blog is a space to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Explore ideas before they're clean and polished</li>
            <li>Document learnings that might help future me (or future you)</li>
            <li>Think in public ‚Äî even if that thinking evolves</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Off the keyboard</h2>
        
        <p>When I'm not building or learning, I'm most likely reading, daydreaming or exercising.
            I try taking care of this meat machine because it's the only real hardware we've got.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Let's talk</h2>
        
        <p>If you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Want to collaborate on weird ideas</li>
            <li>Are building something cool</li>
            <li>Think in strange, or contrarian ways</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reach out. I'd love to hear from you.</p>
