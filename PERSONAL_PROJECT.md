# Personal Django Learning Project

This is a personal project that I want to code by hand so I learn Django properly.

This is **not** a project that I want to prototype rapidly with the assistance of an AI Agent because it has no user value or commercial value except for myself, and the value that it has for me is educational, creative, deep understanding and skill value.

## Different Approaches to Coding

* Projects are about continuously delivering and improving products, and to work with real users. It's (not) about the code. You can have a coding agent write (none, some or all of) the code for you.
* Practicing programming exercises is about learning new concepts, recognizing patterns and building the muscle memory and intuition for these patterns.
* Coding katas are about practicing problem solving skills on a micro scale and improving and developing these low level problem solving skills
* But!
* Don't let Claude Code or another AI agent generate ALL of your projects:
    * Write some by hand completely for deep understanding and most learning
    * Write some with code completion for a medium ground between deep understanding and speed (augmented coding)
    * Write some completely by prompting and context engineering Claude & other AI SWE agents ('vibe coding', prompt engineering, context engineering)
        * Each approach has its trade-offs:
            * Learning & Deep Understanding vs Productivity & Speed & rapid iteration
            * Prompting, providing context and managing AI SWE agent is a skill on its own as well, so practice that skill too!
        * Can you explain the distinction between "augmented coding" and "vibe coding"?
        * In vibe coding you don't care about the code, just the behavior of the system. If there's an error, you feed it back into the genie in hopes of a good enough fix. In augmented coding you care about the code, its complexity, the tests, & their coverage. The value system in augmented coding is similar to hand coding--tidy code that works. It's just that I don't type much of that code.
