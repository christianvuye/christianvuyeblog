# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Django blog project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project, along with their context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [001](001-database-backup-strategy.md) | Database Backup Strategy | Proposed |

## Usage

When making significant architectural decisions:
1. Create a new ADR file with the next sequential number
2. Follow the established format
3. Update this README with the new entry
4. Commit both files together
